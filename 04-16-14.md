## Kruskal's Algorithm

```java
Select u element of V: makeset(u)
A = []
Sort the edges by weight;
Select u,v element of E in increasing order  
  if find_set(u) != find_set(v)
    add edge in {A}
    union(u,v)
```

Run-time  
* Sort the edges by weight = _O(|E|log(|E|))_
* Select u,v element of E + find_set(u) = _O(|E|log(|v|))_
* Union(u,v) = _O(|v|log(|V|))_

### Data Structure for maintaining connected components

* Initially each node is an individual c.c.
* To merge two nodes, create a directed edge from one of them to the other.
* The root of each tree becomes the representative of a connected component

```java
makeset(x)
  pie(x) = x : representative of x
  r(x) = 0 : height of subtree
find_set(x)
  while pie(x) != x
    x = pie(x)
  return x
```

Merging/union, you have to make one of the roots to point to the other one.

```java
union_by_rank(x,y)
  r of x = find(x)
  r of y = find(y)
  if rank(r of x) > rank(r of y)
    pie(r of y) = r of x
  else
    pie(r of x) = r of y
    if rank(r of x) = rank(r of y)
      rank(r of y)++;
```

__Property__: for n elements, there can be at most n/2<sup>k</sup> nodes of rank K  
* maximum rank/height is _log(n)_
* find function is _log(n)_
* union function is _log(n)_

Under certain conditions, sorting edges can be _O(|E|)_, in which case the connected components operating become the bottleneck.

__Idea:__ try to decrease the height of the tree every time we call find, set the &pi;(x) to be the actual representative.

```java
find(x)
  if x != pie(x)
    pie(x) = find(pie(x))
  return x;
```
Run-time: __O(log*n)__  
* Union function will have the same run-time.
* log* is the number of times you take the logarithm of _n_ to bring it down to 1.
* All numbers up to 65536, the value is 4.
* All numbers up to 2<sup>65536</sup>, the value is 5.
* __Kruskal's__ run-time is _O(|E|log*|v|)_

## Hard Problems

__Satisfiability Problem__  
Given a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form  
* i.e.
  - (_x_ v _y_ v _z_) ^ (_x_ v _neg z_) ^ (_z_ v _neg y_) ^ (_y_ v _neg x_) ^ (_neg x_ v _neg y_ v _neg z_)
  - Collection of clauses
  - Clauses: collection of literals (either a boolean variable or its negation)
* An assignment of true or false to each variable so that every clause is true.

__Naive way__  
Search through all assignments -> how many?
* For _n_ variables, there are 2<sup>n<sup> assignments
* Exponential running time

__Feature of search problems__  
It is easy to check the correctness of a condidate solution S.  
* ∃

__Traveling Salesman Problem__  
* Conduct a route on a graph so as to visit every node and return to the originating vertex with the minimum cost.
* _Naive approach_: Evaluate every possible tour (n-1)! possibility
  - Run-time = __O(n!)__
* ∃ dynamic programming
  - Subproblems: for a subset of cities _S_ &isin; {1,2,...,n} that includes the origin (1) and a specific node _j_, let C(S,j) be the length of the shortest path visiting each node in _S_ starting at 1 and stopping at _j_

__Hard Problems__  
C(S,j) = min<sub>i, neighbors of j</sub>(C(S-{j},i) + d<sub>ij</sub>)  
* You must first find a path to a neighbor i (does not go through j) and then add the cost distance<sub>ij</sub>

```java
C({1},1) = 0
for S = 2 to n
  for all subsets S element of {1,...,n} of size S and containing 1
    C(S,1) = infinity
    for all j element of S, j != 1
      C(S,j) = min((S-{j},i) + d of ij)
return min((C|V|,j) + d of j1)
```

Run-time is __O(n<sup>2</sup>n<sup>n</sup>)__, exponential time.
