## Co-NP

A problem is in Co-NP if its complement is in NP.

i.e. verifiable proofs of no instances (counter-example) exist.

__e.g.__
Given a finite set of integers, does every non-empty subset have a nonzero sum?

* A counter-example is easy to verify: add up a set of integers.

* An algorithm that applies to 3-SAT, can also be applied to SAT.
* __(a<sub>1</sub> v a<sub>2</sub> v ... v a<sub>k</sub>)__ is satisfied iff the corresponding 3-CNF formula is satisifed.

The 3-CNF formula
* In order for it to be satisfied, at least one of the a<sub>i</sub> has to be true.
* Assume that there is an assignment of the y<sub>k</sub> that satisfies the 3-CNF formula but the values of the a<sub>i</sub> are such that the top formulas is not satisfied.
  * First choice: we have to set y<sub>1</sub> to T
  * Second choice: '' '' '' y<sub>2</sub> to T
  * '' '' ''
  * Last choice: all literals are false and the 3-CNF formula is not satisfied &larr; contradiction
* If there is an a<sub>i</sub> that satisfies the a

* We must somehow show how we can answer problem involving boolean formulas using graphs.
