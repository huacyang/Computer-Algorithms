## Exam 1 Review

__Give a justiﬁcation why improvements in hardware are typically not sufﬁcient to make an algorithm with exponential running time reasonably tractable.__  
> The algorithm will be so slow that even massive improvements in hardware won't have a useful impact.  
> Exponential growth (running time) > multiplication growth (Moore's Law)

__We have 3 algorithms for the same problem where the ﬁrst runs in `exponential time`, the second in `logarithmic time` and the third in `linear time` as a function of the same input. Which algorithm do you prefer to use?__  
> Exponential time &gt; logarithmic time &gt; linear time

__You may be provided running times of different algorithms and asked to show which running time dominates asymptotically__    
> See [Asymptotic Notation](laws.md#asymptotic-notation) 

__Provide the definition of `Big-O`, `Omega`, and `Theta`.__  
> __O-notation__ is the `asymptotic upper bound`  
> __&Omega;-notation__ is the `asymptotic lower bound`  
> __&Theta;-notation__ is the `asymptotic `   
> See [Asymptotic Notation](laws.md#asymptotic-notation) 

__You may be provided certain statements about asymptotic analysis of running times and asked to show if they are correct or not. For instance: “n<sup>a</sup> dominates n<sub>b</sub> if a > b”.__  
> 

__What is the “primality” problem and what is the “factoring” problem? Which one of the two is tractable? What are the advantages of the intractability of the other problem?__  
> 

__How many digits do you need to represent a number `N` in base `b`__  
> [log<sub>b</sub>N] + 1
